This is the project done for the introductory video.
The project's main goal is to show how to get a working application with Charts in the least possible time.

The following steps are done in the project:
 - create new single-module Vaadin application with Maven (through Eclipse plugin)
 - replace default content with a chart (column chart)
 - set up and connect data to the chart
 - change chart type to something else (bar chart) or customise it in some other way
